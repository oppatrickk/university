</div>
<div class="p4"><img class="img4" src=img7.png><br>Helium Atom</div>
				 <p class="p1">
				 In the perspective of quantum mechanics, helium is the second simplest atom to model, following the hydrogen atom. Helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons along with some neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system consisting of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within < 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps. In such models it is found that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge Z which each electron sees, is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic "bare" helium nucleus.

				 The Related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell
				 </p>	
                 <p class="p1">The nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle. 
				 High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud.
				 This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.
                 </p>
                 <p class="p1">
                 For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.
                 </p>
                 <p class="p1">
                 In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions involving both heavy-particle emission, and fusion. Some stable helium-3 is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction, compared with the highly favorable helium-4.
                 </p>
                 <p class="p1">
                 The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the "soup" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus no energetic drive was available, once helium had been formed, to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.
                 </p>
                 <p class="p1">
                 All heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.

                 <p class="header2">Gas and plasma phases</p>
                 <div class="p3"><img class="img4" src=img8.jpg><br>Helium discharge tube shaped <br>like the element's atomic symbol</div>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Helium is the second least reactive noble gas, after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements.
				 It is inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. 
				 Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen.
				 For similar reasons, and also due to the small size of helium atoms, helium's diffusion rate through solids is three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.
				 </p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Helium is the least water-soluble monatomic gas, and one of the least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5),[47] and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas.
				 Helium has a negative Joule-Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. 
				 Only below its Joule-Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50 K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. O
				 nce precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling
				 </p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Most extraterrestrial helium is found in a plasma state, with properties quite different from those of atomic helium. 
				 In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized.
				 The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.
				 </p>
				 <p class="header2">Liquid helium</p>
				 <div class="p4"><img class=img4 src="img9.png"><br>Liquefied Helium</div>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Unlike any other element, helium will remain liquid down to absolute zero at normal pressures. 
				 This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing. 
				 Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5 K (about −272 °C or −457 °F) and about 25 bar (2.5 MPa) of pressure.
				 It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. 
				 The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%.
				 With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214 ± 0.006 g/cm3 at 1.15 K and 66 atm; the projected density at 0 K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187 ± 0.009 g/cm3.
				 </p>
				 <p class="header2">Helium I state</p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Below its boiling point of 4.22 kelvins and above the lambda point of 2.1768 kelvins, the isotope helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state, called helium I.
				 Like other cryogenic liquids, helium I boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered.
				 Below the lambda point, however, helium does not boil, and it expands as the temperature is lowered further.
				 </p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Helium I has a gas-like index of refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is.
				 This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K),  which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics.
				 Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both types of liquid helium are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale.
				 This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.
				 </p>
				 <p class="header2">Helium II state</p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Liquid helium below its lambda point begins to exhibit very unusual characteristics, in a state called helium II. 
				 When helium II boils, due to its high thermal conductivity it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. 
				 Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about such properties in the isotope.
				 </p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Helium II is a superfluid, a quantum mechanical state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. 
				 For example, when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10−7 to 10−8 m it has no measurable viscosity.
				 However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. 
				 Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. 
				 In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.
				 </p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 In the fountain effect, a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of helium II by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass.
				 If the interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. 
				 In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.
				 </p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 The thermal conductivity of helium II is greater than that of any other known substance, a million times that of helium I and several hundred times that of copper.
				 This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. 
				 Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. 
				 Helium II has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. 
				 When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8 K through helium II as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.
				 </p>
				 <p class="p1">
				 Helium II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the level of helium II, the helium II moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. 
				 Helium II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. 
				 It moves in a 30 nm-thick film regardless of surface material. 
				 This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin.
				 As a result of this creeping behavior and helium II's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, it is very difficult to confine liquid helium. 
				 Unless the container is carefully constructed, the helium II will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. 
				 Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force.T
				 hese waves are known as third sound.
